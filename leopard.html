                    <p class = "animalBoxText">Out of all leopards, the amur leopard is the most critically endangered, only having 84 individuals to its name. They live in the Russian Far East, making their home in temperate forests. This leopard is a solitary cat that can run at speeds up to 37 miles per hour. It can even leap more than 19 feet horizontally and up to 10 feet vertically.
                        Amur leopards are tethering on the brink of extinction. They are poached for their distinct spotted fur. The proximity of Russian villages to the forests make it easily accessible for the leopards to be poached. Additionally, their prey population is scarce due to also being hunted by the locals for food and cash, making it difficult for the leopards to survive. </p>
                    <p class = "animalBoxText">Here at Emma's Zoo, we work hard to keep our leopards happy and healthy.</p>
