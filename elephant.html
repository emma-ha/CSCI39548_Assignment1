                    <p class = "animalBoxText">African forest elephants inhabit the dense rainforests of west and central Africa. They live in groups of 20 and forage on grasses, fruits, and seeds, making them the ‘mega-gardener of the forest’. These elephants are smaller than other African elephant species. Their tusks are straighter and point downward, and their ears are oval shaped. Forest elephants also have lower reproductive rates than other elephants, meaning they cannot bounce back as quickly from population declines.
                        African forest elephants are critically endangered and poaching for ivory and bushmeat is the most immediate threat. Thousands of elephants are illegally killed each year to meet the demand for ivory. These elephants also suffer from habitat loss as humans convert land for agriculture, settlements, and developments. Since people and elephants are increasingly coming into contact with each other, it leads to conflicts that the elephants habitually lose. </p>
